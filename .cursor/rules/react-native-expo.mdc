# React Native & Expo Coding Standards

## Components & Hooks
- Use **Functional Components** with Hooks. Avoid Class components.
- Use `Expo Image` for high-performance image rendering.
- Use `SafeAreaView` from `react-native-safe-area-context` where appropriate.
- Prefer **Early Returns** to reduce nesting depth.

## Expo Router v6
- **Routing:** Use file-based routing in the `app/` directory.
- **Logic:** Keep routing logic in `app/`, but move business logic and complex UI to `components/` or hooks.

## TypeScript
- **No `any`:** Avoid using `any` type. Define explicit interfaces.
- **Strict Mode:** Adhere to strict typing rules.
- **Props:** Define Props interfaces for all components.
