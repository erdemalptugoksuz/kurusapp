# User Rules & Language Conventions
- **Language Separation:**
  - **UI/Content:** ALL visible application text, alerts, buttons, and labels MUST be in **Turkish**.
  - **Codebase:** ALL variable names, function names, comments, commit messages, and documentation MUST be in **English**.
- **Code Quality:**
  - Adhere to strict clean code principles.
  - No spaghetti code; prioritize modularity.
  - Use PascalCase for components, camelCase for variables/functions.

# Directory Structure & File Organization
- **Do not** put logic inside `app/` screens unless it's routing specific.
- **Components:** Create reusable UI components in `components/`.
- **Types/Interfaces:**
  - Define all types in `types/` folder.
  - Define all interfaces in `interfaces/` folder (or combined `types/` if preferred, but keep them separate from component logic).
- **Services:** Supabase and API logic goes into `lib/` or `services/`.
- **Example Structure:**
  ```
  /app          (Routes only)
  /components   (Reusable UI)
  /types        (Global types)
  /interfaces   (Global interfaces)
  /lib          (Supabase client, helpers)
  /assets       (Images, fonts)
  ```

# Development Workflow
- **Linting:** Check for linter errors after major changes.
- **Refactoring:** When modifying a file, leave it cleaner than you found it.
